# About Me

Hello! I'm Dibyendu Ghosh, a physics enthusiast passionate about General Relativity, scientific computing, and astrophotography. I hold an MSc in Physics and aspire to pursue a PhD in General Relativity.

# Research Interests

My primary research focus is General Relativity, exploring the mathematical and computational aspects of Einstein's field equations. I am particularly interested in numerical simulations and theoretical studies related to black holes and spacetime geometry.

# Programming & Scientific Computing

I actively work with Julia and Python, leveraging their power for scientific computing, simulations, and numerical analysis. I enjoy tackling problems in computational physics and implementing efficient algorithms to model physical systems.

# Electronics & Projects

Beyond physics and programming, I have a strong interest in electronics. I enjoy working on hardware projects, embedded systems, and experimenting with circuits to understand the underlying physics of electronic devices.

# Astrophotography

As a hobby, I capture the beauty of the night sky through astrophotography. Observing celestial objects and processing astronomical images is both a scientific pursuit and an artistic expression for me.

# Contact

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss physics, programming, or any exciting projects!
